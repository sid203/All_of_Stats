Non Parametric Bayesian Density Estimation : 

This project is a detailed study of carrying out density estimation in completely non-parametric settings. 
Specifically, I implement the Algorithm 7 published by Radford Neal in this paper : http://www.stat.columbia.edu/npbayes/papers/neal_sampling.pdf
