Summary : Generalized Additive Models , another class of regressors for doing (semi) nonparametric regression. One can express a GAM as :

y = a + m1(x1) + m2(x2) + m3(x3).....  

where m1 , m2 , m3 ....mn are any class of "smooth" functions which are estimated from the data. Typically you usually write a 1-Dimensional smoother which maybe splines or a kernel smoother. Regress on all covariates except for the ith covariate Xi , and obtain the residuals. These residuals are made smooth again wrt to 
the ith smoother. This is called Backfitting. 

One can also extend the above framework to SpAMs which is Sparse Additive Models. Just run the above backfitting , and soft threshold the ith smoothing function 
by calculating the L1 Norm of the ith smoother. 

This is the original paper about SpAMs : https://arxiv.org/pdf/0711.4555.pdf
